# Minimax vs Alpha-Beta Pruning

## üß† Minimax Algorithm

### ‚úÖ Pros
- Guarantees the best possible move assuming the opponent plays optimally.
- Simple to implement and understand.
- Forms the basis of many adversarial search algorithms.

### ‚ùå Cons
- Exponential time complexity: O(b^d), where `b` is branching factor and `d` is depth.
- Inefficient for deep game trees.
- Evaluates every possible node, even when unnecessary.

## ‚úÇÔ∏è Alpha-Beta Pruning (Optimized Minimax)

### ‚úÖ Pros
- Prunes branches that won‚Äôt affect the final decision, reducing the number of nodes evaluated.
- Much faster than plain Minimax in practice.
- Same result as Minimax but with improved performance.
- Can go deeper in the search tree within the same time constraints.

### ‚ùå Cons
- Still exponential in worst case (O(b^d)), but improved in best case.
- Efficiency heavily depends on move ordering (best when good moves are evaluated early).
- Slightly more complex to implement than basic Minimax.
